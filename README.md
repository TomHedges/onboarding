# Onboarding

This document aims to outlines some areas of interest when onboarding as a front-end developer at Just Giving.

## Slack groups

* 111-fr-one-page
* 114-timeline

* funtech
* graphql
* jgtech

## Github

[Github](https://github.com/) is used as storage for work produced at JG. Work is split between [Github Enterprise](https://source.justgiving.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/JustGiving), with the aim of migrating old projects in Github Enterprise over to Github.

### Privilages

For both sites you will require admin privilages in order to see private repositories. Invitation links should be emailed to you. In the case that they aren't, speak to Tomasz Cudok.

### PRs

Pull Requests are used to discuss and review new work that's been created for a project. A pull request is opened with the intention that the code within it, once approved, can be pulled into the main repository.

When a branch is created locally, the changes within it first need to be staged locally, `git add -a -m "new commit message"`, and then pushed to the remote repository, `git push -u origin <branch-name>`. 

The changes can then be compared to a receiving branch and a PR can be opened. See [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for more info.

Make sure to be descriptive as possible in the PR message. A link to a relating JIRA ticket and small description of feature added/problem solved is useful. Additionally, for any front-end tasks, a screenshot of the change made is a good idea.
