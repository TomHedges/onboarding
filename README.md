## Github

[Github](https://github.com/) is used as storage for work produced at JG. Work is split between [Github Enterprise](https://source.justgiving.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/JustGiving), with the aim of migrating old projects in Github Enterprise over to Github.

For both sites you will require admin privilages in order to see private repositories. Invitation links should be emailed to you. In the case that they aren't, speak to Tomasz Cudok.
